# OptimalThresholdForBinaryClassification
This project simply entails the technicalities of how to find the best threshold when solving a classification problem

I created an artificial dataset from the scikit-learn's dataset library called make_classification, that generates a random n-class classification problem.
Trained four(4) machine learning classification models
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- AdaBoost classifier
- KNN Classifier

Applied some coding techniques that suits my findings

Created the thresholds and accuracy for all four combined models
Finally, selected the best threshold based on the highest accuracy.
